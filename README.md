# TODO:

- Include a guide to setup the project in local environment

- after comparing, give them a special name i.e "Indie Hacker, Reply Guy, etc"

  - Special name ideas:
  - `` - 5:0 commits to tweets
  - `Grinder` - 3:1 commits to tweets
  - `` - 2:1 commits to tweets
  - `Perfectly Balanced` - 1:1 commits to tweets
  - `Shiposter` - 1:2 commits to tweets
  - `Indie Hacker` - 1:3 commits to tweets
  - `Reply Guy` - 1:4 commits to tweets
  - `Influencer` - 1:5 commits to tweets

- while streaming the heatmap calendar, pop in their most commits in a day or biggest tweet
- after comparing, show people with similar ratios
- have a leaderboard, sorted from most to least commit ratios
- for holidays, callout tweeting, coding, or living
